-> HOWTO for reward.

Here is the meaning of each parameter in the codes section:
    name: the name of the reward code that you will display (e.g.: “reward code”, “gift card number”, “voucher code”, “pin code”, etc.)
    value: the actual reward code you need to display to your customers. It is the code that your customers will use to redeem on the reward website
    format: the format in which this code is displayed (string or link)
    usage: the usage for the reward code.

Here are two examples of API answers, with one or two codes:

With one code:
"codes": [
        {
          "name": "Reward Code",
          "value": “ABCDE-12345"
          "format": "string",
          "usage": "primary"
        }
]

=> This means you have to display the value “ABCDE-12345” to your customers

With two codes:
"codes": [
        {
          "name": “Gift Card Number",
          "value": “ABCDE-12345"
          "format": "string",
          "usage": "primary"
        }
        {
          "name": “Pin Code",
          "value": “WXYZ"
          "format": "string",
          "usage": “security"
        }
]

=> This means you have to display both values to your customers, with their name associated, like this:
Gift Card Number: ABCDE-12345
Pin Code WXYZ
